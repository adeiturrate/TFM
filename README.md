# TFM: Skin Lesion Classification with Machine Learning

This repository contains the code and results for the automated classification of skin lesions from dermoscopic images using deep learning models and few-shot learning (FSL) methods.

## Description

This project evaluates different Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and FSL approaches to classify skin lesions. The goal is to address challenges like **class imbalance** and **limited data availability**.

### Objectives
- Compare traditional CNN architectures like Simple CNN, Inception v3, and EfficientNet-B3.
- Apply FSL techniques with Prototypical Networks.
- Improve the detection of underrepresented classes like dermatofibromas (DF) and vascular lesions (VASC).
